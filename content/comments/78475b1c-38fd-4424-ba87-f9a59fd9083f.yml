  Homes near the coast are exposed to high winds, humidity, and heavy rain,
  which can reduce the lifespan of roofing materials. Routine evaluations help
  catch small problems before they spread into expensive repairs. A experienced
  roofing company can inspect vents and recommend updates suited for coastal
  environments. Roof types designed for harsh weather often perform better when
  installed correctly, helping protect the home over time.  \r
