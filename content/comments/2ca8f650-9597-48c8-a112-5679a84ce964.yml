message: "One thing I don’t see talked about enough is the decision between
  fixing a roof and replacing it. It feels like the right choice really depends
  on age, roofing material, and how often repairs keep coming up. A newer roof
  with isolated issues is one situation, but repeated problems might be a sign
  of something bigger. I’ve been reading more about how inspections can help
  homeowners make better long-term decisions instead of just reacting when leaks
  show up. \r
