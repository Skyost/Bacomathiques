  After shaking hands - it was the first time they had met - the pair debated
  policy before moving onto more personal attacks \r

  \ \r

  Harris said people leave Trump rallies early \"out of exhaustion and boredom\"
  - he said people don't go to hers in the first place \r

  Trump criticised Harris's record on immigration and the border, and also her
  shifting policy positions - Harris blamed him for \"Trump abortion bans\" and
  for the 6 January attacks on the US Capitol \r

  \ \r

  Snap polls suggest Harris won the debate, but Trump says afterwards that she
  \"lost very badly\" \r

  \ \r

  With the election taking place on 5 November, Harris is slightly ahead in
  national opinion polls - but polls are very tight in key battleground states
  \r

  \ \r

  Shortly after the debate, Taylor Swift endorsed Harris on Instagram, calling
  her a ''gifted leader''"
